The first 47 code points of this file, ignoring spaces, carriage returns, and
line feeds, define the lowercase layout, based on an ANSI physical layout read
by rows.  The next 47 define the uppercase layout.

These code points must lie in the Basic Multilingual Plane.

Any further characters in this file are ignored.

This file is NOT in a Unicode Normal Form; combining marks will be input as-is.

The lowercase layout is used for cuneiform composition. In order to be able to
input all composition sequences, it should include the following:
— the basic Akkadian alphabet [abdegḫijlmnpqrsṣštṭuwz];
— the letter ʾaleph [ʾ];
— the letters [ŋ] for Sumerian values and [ś] for Old Akkadian values;
— the digits [0] through [9] and the letter [x], for homophone indices;
— the signs [-] and [+], for simplified and complexified forms of signs;
— the forward slash [/], for word dividers (both the usual zero-width space and
  the Kültepe word divider 𒑰) as well as fractions;
— the punctuation signs [:] and [⫶];
— the letter [f], as a shorthand for the determinative 𒊩;
— the letter [v], for variants.

The lowercase layout further defines the behaviour of keyboard shortcuts using
the control key; note that Ctrl+š is sent as Ctrl+c, and Ctrl+ḫ is sent as
Ctrl+h.

The characters from the lowercase layout are typed directly when the shift key
is held with caps lock off, or when caps lock is on, with the following
adjustments:
— digits are typed as subscripts;
— the letter [x] is typed as subscript.
When the shift key is held with caps lock on, the characters from the uppercase
layout are typed.  The intent is that caps lock be used for writing
transcriptions and transliterated Akkadian.

Superscript one [¹] stands for a dead key with the following effect on the next
keypress:
— digits and [x] are typed normally, rather than as subscripts;
— [d], [f], [m], [+], and [-] are typed as superscripts;
— [¹] goes through.
In particular, the determinative shorthands ᵈ, ᶠ, ᵐ, and ¹ can be typed as
[¹][d], [¹][f], [¹][m], and [¹][¹] respectively.
